Spike Projects related to extending off the shelf Kendo Mvc Functionality

Excel like custom filters
-------------------------
* Selected columns can have a customised filter which is similar to Excels filter functionality
* A hard coded or server rendered list of distinct values will render in to a kendo list view and replace the native filter popup
* Will need to be revisited when kendo releases this functionality built in
